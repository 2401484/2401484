    "text": "My Journey Before SIT\nBefore joining SIT, I pursued a diploma in Business Intelligence and Analytics, where I developed a strong foundation in using data to drive smarter business decisions.\nDuring that time, I was exposed to a mix of technical and business subjects, including: - Data visualization using tools like Tableau and Power BI - Basic data modeling and SQL - Predictive analytics using Excel and R - Business strategy and case analysis\nAlthough I didn‚Äôt have a formal Final Year Project, I worked on several mini-projects and coursework that helped sharpen my ability to extract insights from messy data and communicate them clearly.\nThis experience sparked my interest in data-driven decision making ‚Äî which is what led me to continue exploring analytics at a deeper level in SIT.\n\n\n\nWhat I Gained\n\nA solid grasp of BI tools and dashboards\n\nThe ability to communicate findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders\n\nCuriosity to explore more advanced machine learning and AI applications"
