# Reflection on the Use of GenAI

## What GenAI Tool Did I Use?

I used [**ChatGPT**](https://chat.openai.com) by OpenAI.

I chose it because it is easy to talk to, fast, and gives helpful answers. I can ask it to explain things step by step.

## How It Helped Me

Here are some examples:

- It helped me create the content like `aboutnotme.qmd` and `travel.qmd`.
- It helped me fix mistakes I didn’t understand by giving suggestions.
- It guided me on how to update `_quarto.yml`.

---

## Benefits

- Fast and always ready to help.
- Clear answers in plain English.
- Helps when I don’t understand instructions.

---

## Challenges

- Sometimes the answer is too long or too complicated.
- I need to double-check if the answer is correct.
- It doesn’t always know exactly what I mean unless I am very clear.
