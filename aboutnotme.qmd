# My Journey Before SIT

Before joining SIT, I pursued a diploma in **Business Intelligence and Analytics**, where I developed a strong foundation in using data to drive smarter business decisions.

During that time, I was exposed to a mix of technical and business subjects, including:
- Data visualization using tools like Tableau and Power BI
- Basic data modeling and SQL
- Predictive analytics using Excel and R
- Business strategy and case analysis

Although I didn’t have a formal Final Year Project, I worked on several **mini-projects and coursework** that helped sharpen my ability to extract insights from messy data and communicate them clearly.

This experience sparked my interest in data-driven decision making — which is what led me to continue exploring analytics at a deeper level in SIT.
